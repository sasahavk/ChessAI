## Models
2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**
   - Try different dept (1-4)
   - Early, middle, late stage
3. **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**
   - Simulation counts (100 - 500)
   -  Early, middle, late stage
4. **Neural Network**
   - Train for all stages together
   - Train separately for each stage
     - 25/50/25 split  or 20/50/30
   - Train with different dataset size per stage
     - 10000 - 50000 (small)
     - 100000 - 500000 (medium)

## Presentation
- Choose bot to play against (among 4 best ones, one of each type)
- Have choice of playing bot vs bot
- Demonstrate win rates againts each other
- Demonstrate win rates against stockfish
-
